# Toshiba-Soundbar-Standby-Workaround

A Visual Basic Script to workaround the automatic standby feature on my Toshiba soundbar. This is done by playing a high pitch (unhearable) tone within a windowless player. This script is then ran as a scheduled task every 9 minutes whilst my computer is running thus ensuring there is no 10 minute window within which the soundbar doesn't emit a sound (when this condition is met the soundbar enters standby mode, meaning it has to be manually switched on again).
